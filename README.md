# cjdata
A very small package to read a CSV file from Qualtrics and reshape the data for conjoint analysis. The current version only supports analysis for a binary-choice outcome. Users should wrangle respondent-level separately and merge them by each respondent's id. 


### Notes:

- The binary profile names should be {"Something 1", "Something 2"} or ({Something A", "Something B"}.
