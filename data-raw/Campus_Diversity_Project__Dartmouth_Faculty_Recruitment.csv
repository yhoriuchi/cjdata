is my opinion that Dartmouth currently takes race into account when hiring faculty, specifically selecting faculty of ""color"" (no one seems to know if asians count in this category). This has resulted in several of my friends, about half of them minority students and slightly more than half women, declaring that black/hispanic professors are less good and more likely to be politically biased. As a result these students choose when given the option to take a class with a ""old white male"" professor, rather than whatever minority of the day is being favored. I think this is a tragic but predictable response to discrimination against white potential professors. There are many other likely unintended consequences of this policy.  /  / It's worth noting that I was head of a minority group in high school, and that I have always preferred helping students and young people who are black/hispanic/native american to reach their full potential, rather than discriminating against their counterparts.

I have my first class with a non-white professor this term, as a senior. I’ve talked to this professor about some of his research that relates to race and it’s been very interesting and relevant to me — wouldn’t have expected that before, though",

was founded with the intent of educating Native students. It would be great to have more indigenous professors: Native American, Alaskan, Hawaiian. Even Latino/a, and people of color. Diversity is wonderful and when you even see it in the classroom- it is astounding. I think anyone can make a great teacher if they want to be and have the opportunity. I have had some very educated, highly classified teachers, that were very bad at their job. They knew if too well and were so good at what they knew that they failed to properly teach it to those of us who knew nothing about it. I have also had teachers who may not have went to elite colleges, but they taught in such a way, that I could do their work in my sleep. As someone from a mixed background, I would like to see more diverse faculty.",

way the tables presented the candidates made it confusing for me to know what aspects of a candidate I was supposed to consider more important vs less important, and how that would compare with the actual hiring process at Dartmouth. For example, would the school really put the resumes of two candidates that were applying to different kinds of positions in different departments side-by-side and pick one or the other? Would a tenure-track economics professor's resume really be compared with that of a visiting non-tenure professor? Because of this, I completely ignored department and position type when considering candidates. To describe my thought process when selecting candidates, I preferred candidates who attended Dartmouth, but otherwise did not care what school a candidate attended, as a highly-motivated candidate from a less well-known school could be better than a mediocre candidate from a more famous school. I also preferred candidates who had excellent research and/or teaching merits, except for when one of those merits was fair. In that case I preferred a more well-rounded candidate (either good or excellent for both). If both candidates had a fair and an excellent in either research or teaching, then I preferred the candidate who was an excellent teacher. Race and gender did not enter into my consideration unless two candidates were otherwise completely identical--then I would pick the minority candidate. The spouse being either Dartmouth or non-Dartmouth had no bearing on my choices, as that's not relevant to the candidate's ability to be a good professor.",

aspect of comparison between possible candidates that presented the greatest difficulty for me in evaluation was whether they were candidates to be a visiting professor or tenured. I tend to agree with merit, but see the value in diversity; therefore, my thought process was somewhat that a visiting professor that's more qualified ought to be considered before someone less qualified for tenure, as even if the visiting professor is lacking in diversity, they will leave and will eventually will be replaced by someone with greater diversity, but I am entirely unsure whether this train of thought is accurate or valid.",

disagree strongly with the survey methods and questions here. We were asked to use shallow generalizations about “fair” vs “good” research backgrounds, university rankings, etc to make decisions about candidates. In real life, I’d hope that more nuanced decisions based on things like research topics, teaching ability, the existing make up of a department, etc would be considered. Decisions based on these shallow assumptions in this survey seem like they would not achieve the desired faculty diversity or rigor. They also perpetuate and trigger thinking implicit bias because we’re asked to rely on assumptions. Also, the last few hypothetical questions were so offensive. Those are about real people’s lives and not for sanitized research. Just awful overall. ",

on the example tables and question stems, this is an incredibly problematic and one dimensional  survey with biased assumptions that also happens to be terribly  worded and crafted.  I would assume professional political scientists  would be more nuanced and less disrespectful. I’ll be curious to hear how the media responds to this after sending. I am an alum of Dartmouth and will be submitting letters to the appropriate deans for censure and will also write to the IRB. Oh but what if the time, effort, and funding afforded to this project and legitimizing rational for “merit” based hiring could have gone to the cause of say, actually working toward improving diversity. “Merit”!is an absolute farce — one need not look farther than the White House ( the occupant who has recently noted his having attended “ the very best colleges).”  Whites have benefited from legacy status — essentially a whites only clause given the legal history of excluding blacks— for decades. When blacks and others demand equality they are asking for special favors. I suggest you read historian Carol Anderson’s new book titled White Rage for an excellent primer on the history of affirmative action and the historical fallacy of “merit”. I use quotes for the term merit to not only signal the fallacy of the term but to also suggest that your definition of merit, as evidenced by your question stems and clear premise, is problematic too.  /  / From an inclusion and diversity perspective, Dartmouth is truly the laughing stock of the Ivy League ( having attended two and now at Oxford) and this, on face, seems to be is an awfully crafted  and biased survey.  /  / I wish more money and resources were afforded to understanding how faculty members of color and women feel, say even within your department, versus time spent on rehashing affirmative action debates and student opinions we have had since the first AA programs were rolled out in the 80s.

distinction between ""only merit"" and ""taking race into account"" is a false dichotomy; it reveals a dangerous misunderstanding of the argument that identity be considered in selecting faculty. Those who argue that race, gender, and other identities should be considered are in reality arguing for the recognition of a different epistemological framework, which recognizes the lived experience of marginalization and oppression in society as a valid and crucial form of knowledge that is missing when we only consider the categories of research output and teaching record (how is this measured, by the way?) in determining the merit of potential hires.  /  / I strongly urge those evaluating the data this survey yields to explore and understand this argument. I'm happy to speak more on this point; you can reach me at F00254Q@kiewit.dartmouth.edu. ",

am an international student and I feel like some questions (like the one about political affiliation) does not consider me. 10% of the student body is international and is a group of people that is not taken into consideration for many of the college's decisions. Also, universities like Harvard and Yale have professors who are foreigners in the departments that they may be important. The only two Brazilian professors at Dartmouth are (Portuguese) language professors. The Latin American, Latino, & Caribbean Studies does not have one single class about Brazil - the largest and richest country in Latin America. I have friends from Brown, Harvard, and Columbia, for instance, who have Brazilian professors teaching in the Government department.",
